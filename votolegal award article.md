The Brazilian organization MCCE (Movement Combatting Corruption in Elections) won the prestigious Innovare 2018 Award in the category of Justice and Citizenship for their work creating political transparency using blockchain data anchoring.

The MCCE was selected of more than 200 practices from all over Brazil in the "Justice and Citizenship" category, on Thursday morning (6/12).  MCCE received the awared in the White Hall of the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court.

Considered the most important award of Brazilian Justice for the last 15 years, the Innovare award recognizes transformative practices that promote justice in Brazil. In addition to recognition, the Award is utilized to identify concrete actions and changes that can be implemented by the Brazilian Department of Justice.

For co-founder and co-founder of MCCE, Luciano Santos, Innovare is an important recognition of the work done by the partnership between MCCE and APPCívico (and by several other organizations). "Receiving an award for the MCCE is always a joy because it is a work of volunteers, of selfless people who fight to fight against electoral corruption in Brazil. This award is a tribute to all those who collaborate with the MCCE," Santos said.

Carlos Moura, co-founder and co-founder of MCCE, stressed that the Innovare award goes not just to MCCE but for the whole movement.  He stated it represents the progress in combating electoral corruption by the movement and the people of Brazil taking part.

Miguel Angelo, co-director of the Movement, said: "Winning the Prize is a great honor because it comes from a lot of work and a lot of dedication. It is a merit for our work. Congratulations to the MCCE, to our entire network of entities and to all those who contributed to this achievement. "

Representing APPCIVICO, Thiago Rondon, said "Innovare 2018 was for MCCE and APPCIVICO very important because the project has been bringing purpose to emerging technologies, in the sense of social control, transparency, and fight against corruption. This is very rewarding, as well as being able to share, to spread these ideas better" Rondon added.

The Voto Legal (http://votolegal.com.br) electoral donation collection platform was conceived by the Movement to Combat Corruption in Elections (MCCE), an organization that created the Ficha Limpa law (LC nº 135/10), and the APPCívico technology company. The platform acted in the 2016 and 2018 elections with the objective of facilitating the donation to electoral campaigns with transparency in the exercise of citizenship, using dcrtime, a blockchain anchoring tool by the Decred Project (https://decred.org).

The impact of the construction of the platform was the expansion of the debate about collective financing of electoral campaigns with the TSE, Public Ministry and civil society organizations.
